Machine Learning Study Notes :-

Notes#1 
- Basic python programming concepts including different data types ; 
- NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn 

Notes#2 
- MatplotLib, Dimensionality Reduction, Singular Value Decomposition, Eigen Vector, Covariance, PCA, feature engineering  ; 
- Code examples using Iris and Titanic datasets
- Iris dataset : contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant
- Titanic datset : contains Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (S), their age (A), their passenger-class (C), their sex (G) and the fare they paid (X)


Notes#3 
- Keras, Netwon Rhapson method, 
- Code example using mnist dataset (standard database of handwritten digits)


Notes#4 
- Simple Linear Regression, Multi Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression 
- Code example using Amazon and Google stock data


Notes#5 
- Support Vector Machine(SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree
- Code examples using breast-cancer-wisconsin (characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image) and Titanic dataset 

Notes#6 
- Ensemble (Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting), Simple K-means clustering  
- Code examples using breast-cancer-wisconsin and Titanic dataset 

Notes#7 
- Tensorflow, RNN, LSTM
